# Embedded unit

This is a fork of the original (likely discontinued) Emb(edded)Unit project, which can be found on SourceForge: https://sourceforge.net/projects/embunit/

The full (CVS) history was exported along with the code to git. The original state of the SourceForge project is tagged with tag `SOURCEFORGE_EXPORT`

## Minimal requirements:

- 2KB ROM/FLASH/..
- 128b RAM

These are the minimal requirements as stated in the original EmbUnit project. These can obviously differ based on your compilation target and compiler.

The unittest code doesn't explicitly rely on any standard library functions.

## User documentation

The full documentation is published in github pages and can be found here: https://bavovanachte.github.io/EmbeddedUnit/
